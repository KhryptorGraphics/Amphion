# Workflow

## Development Process

1. **Track Creation:** Define spec and plan for each feature
2. **Implementation:** Follow plan phases sequentially
3. **Verification:** Test after each phase completion
4. **Deployment:** Update services and verify end-to-end

## Commit Strategy

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`
- Include track ID in commit messages
- Co-authored with Claude

## Code Review

- Self-review for straightforward changes
- Manual verification at phase completion

## TDD Policy

- Moderate: Tests encouraged for API endpoints
- Frontend: Manual testing via browser

## Verification Checkpoints

- After each phase: Verify functionality works
- At track completion: Full integration test
