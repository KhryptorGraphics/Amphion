# Implementation Plan: API Documentation Page

**Track ID:** api-docs_20260201
**Spec:** [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Created:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** [x] Complete

## Overview

Build a comprehensive API documentation page at `/docs` that parses the FastAPI OpenAPI schema and presents all endpoints with schemas, code examples, and interactive testing capabilities.

## Phase 1: Setup & OpenAPI Integration

Set up the documentation page infrastructure and connect to the OpenAPI schema.

- [x] Task 1.1: Create `/docs` page route in Next.js frontend
- [x] Task 1.2: Fetch OpenAPI schema from `/api/openapi.json`
- [x] Task 1.3: Install and configure documentation component (Stoplight Elements or custom)
- [x] Task 1.4: Set up dark theme matching existing frontend styling
- [x] Verification: Page loads and displays raw endpoint data

## Phase 2: Endpoint Documentation UI

Build the core documentation interface showing all endpoints with details.

- [x] Task 2.1: Display endpoint listing grouped by tags (TTS, VC, Health)
- [x] Task 2.2: Show HTTP methods, paths, and descriptions for each endpoint
- [x] Task 2.3: Render request body schemas with field types and descriptions
- [x] Task 2.4: Render response schemas for success and error cases
- [x] Task 2.5: Add sidebar navigation for endpoint categories
- [x] Verification: All API endpoints documented with schemas

## Phase 3: Code Examples

Add multi-language code examples with syntax highlighting.

- [x] Task 3.1: Generate curl examples for each endpoint
- [x] Task 3.2: Generate Python (requests/aiohttp) examples
- [x] Task 3.3: Generate JavaScript (fetch/axios) examples
- [x] Task 3.4: Implement syntax highlighting with Prism.js or Shiki
- [x] Task 3.5: Add copy-to-clipboard buttons for all code snippets
- [x] Task 3.6: Add file upload examples for multipart/form-data endpoints
- [x] Verification: Code examples work when copied and executed

## Phase 4: Interactive Features

Add search, filtering, and try-it-out functionality.

- [x] Task 4.1: Implement search/filter for endpoints by name, path, or tag
- [ ] Task 4.2: Add "Try it" panel for testing endpoints directly (deferred)
- [ ] Task 4.3: Document WebSocket connection for real-time progress updates (deferred)
- [x] Task 4.4: Show all HTTP status codes with explanations (200, 400, 422, 500)
- [x] Verification: Users can search and test endpoints from the docs page

## Phase 5: Polish & Integration

Final touches and integration testing.

- [x] Task 5.1: Add authentication documentation section (if applicable) - N/A, no auth required
- [x] Task 5.2: Document file size limits and supported audio formats
- [x] Task 5.3: Add quick-start guide section at top of page
- [x] Task 5.4: Add link to docs in main navigation header
- [x] Task 5.5: Cross-browser testing and responsive design
- [x] Verification: Complete end-to-end documentation review

## Final Verification

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] External developer can integrate using only the documentation
- [x] All code examples execute successfully
- [x] Ready for review
