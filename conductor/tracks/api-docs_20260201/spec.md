# Specification: API Documentation Page

**Track ID:** api-docs_20260201
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

A comprehensive API documentation page that provides all information needed for external projects to connect and use every Amphion API endpoint, including schemas, capabilities, and proper usage patterns.

## Context

The Amphion Web Frontend has a FastAPI backend exposing TTS and VC capabilities. External developers need clear documentation to integrate these APIs into their applications.

## User Story

As a developer integrating Amphion into my application, I want comprehensive API documentation so that I can easily connect and use all TTS/VC capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API documentation page accessible at `/docs`
- [ ] All endpoints listed with HTTP methods, paths, and descriptions
- [ ] Request/response schemas displayed for each endpoint
- [ ] Authentication requirements documented (if any)
- [ ] Code examples in multiple languages (curl, Python, JavaScript)
- [ ] WebSocket connection instructions for real-time progress
- [ ] Interactive "Try it" functionality to test endpoints

## Dependencies

- Existing FastAPI backend at `/api/` (models/web/api/)
- OpenAPI schema auto-generated at `/api/openapi.json`

## Out of Scope

- User authentication system
- Rate limiting implementation

## Technical Notes

- Use Next.js page at `/docs` route
- Parse OpenAPI schema from `/api/openapi.json`
- Use documentation component (Stoplight Elements, Redoc, or custom)
- Match existing dark theme styling
- Syntax highlighting with Prism.js or Shiki
- Copy-to-clipboard for all code snippets
- Search/filter functionality for endpoints
- Document all response status codes
- Include file upload examples with size limits
