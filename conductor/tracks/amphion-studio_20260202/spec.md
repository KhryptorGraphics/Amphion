# Specification: Amphion Studio - Full-Featured Interface

**Track ID:** amphion-studio_20260202
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Replace the Gradio demo interface with a comprehensive, modern React frontend that exposes ALL Amphion capabilities—TTS, VC, SVC, TTA, Codecs, Vocoders, Evaluation Metrics, Training, and Dataset Management—with full parameter controls, batch processing, and professional content creation workflows.

## Context

The Amphion toolkit is a powerful open-source platform for audio generation, but the current web interface only exposes a fraction of its capabilities through Gradio iframes. Users cannot access the full range of models, fine-tune parameters, or leverage advanced features like training and evaluation without writing code.

## User Story

As a **user of Amphion**, I want to **access every model, feature, and configuration option through a modern web interface** so that **I can leverage the full power of the toolkit for any audio generation task**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All TTS models accessible (MaskGCT, DualCodec-VALLE, Vevo TTS, VALLE, VITS, FastSpeech2, NaturalSpeech2, Jets, Metis, DebaTTS)
- [ ] All VC models accessible (Vevo Voice/Timbre/Style, Noro)
- [ ] SVC (Singing Voice Conversion) interface available
- [ ] TTA (Text-to-Audio) interface available
- [ ] Full parameter controls for each model (temperature, top_k, top_p, etc.)
- [ ] Audio history with playback, download, and comparison
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple inputs
- [ ] Real-time progress via WebSocket
- [ ] Model management (load/unload, memory stats)
- [ ] Responsive design for desktop and tablet

## Dependencies

### Backend API (needs new endpoints)
- TTS: VALLE, VITS, FastSpeech2, NaturalSpeech2, Jets, Metis, DebaTTS
- SVC: DiffComoSVC, TransformerSVC, VitsSVC, MultipleContentsSVC, VevoSing
- TTA: AudioLDM, PicoAudio
- Codecs: FAcodec, DualCodec, NS3 Codec, SpeechTokenizer (encode/decode)
- Vocoders: HiFiGAN, BigVGAN, NSFHiFiGAN, APNet, DiffWave, Vocos
- Evaluation: F0 metrics, speaker similarity, intelligibility, spectral metrics
- Training: Training job management, checkpoint handling
- Dataset: Upload, preprocessing, validation

### Existing Infrastructure
- FastAPI backend at /api/ (extend)
- Next.js frontend at /react/ (rebuild/extend)
- Apache proxy configuration
- systemd service management

### Model Checkpoints
- Various HuggingFace downloads required
- External pretrained models (WavLM, ContentVec, etc.)

## Out of Scope

- User authentication/accounts system
- Multi-user/team features
- Cloud deployment/scaling
- Mobile app (web responsive only)
- Paid/subscription features

## In Scope (Extended)

- Model training interfaces
- Dataset management/preprocessing tools
- Custom model upload capability

## Technical Notes

1. **Architecture:** Extend existing Next.js 15 + FastAPI stack
2. **State Management:** React Context or Zustand for complex state
3. **File Handling:** Chunked uploads for large audio/datasets
4. **GPU Memory:** Model loading/unloading UI to manage VRAM
5. **Progress Tracking:** WebSocket for long-running training jobs
6. **Design System:** Extend existing Tailwind + Radix UI components
7. **Platform:** Jetson Thor with CUDA 13.0 / SM 11.0
8. **Audio Visualization:** Waveform displays, spectrograms, F0 contour plots
9. **Caching Strategy:** Client-side and server-side caching for outputs
10. **Job Queue System:** Background task queue for batch/training jobs
11. **Export Formats:** WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG; project export/import
12. **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Power-user keybindings
13. **Inline Documentation:** Contextual help and parameter explanations
14. **Error Recovery:** Graceful degradation and retry logic
